Assignment 2 [10 marks]
Deadline: 12 Dec 2025

* This assignment can be done in teams of 5 students or less.
* Team members must be from the same lab so the TA can discuss all of them during one lab time.
* Each team must come up with their own implementation.
* Each student in the team must understand all details of the implementation.
* The code must contain no more than 15,000 characters.
* Your code must NOT include any TAB character. Convert each TAB to 4 spaces before submitting.
* You are not allowed to copy any piece of code from the internet or from any other resource.
* You are not allowed to copy any piece of code from other students.
* You are not allowed to include any files or built-in libraries, except for the described ones.
* Your coding style must follow exactly the coding style specified in CodingStyle.pdf.
* Half the mark is dedicated to comments explaining the code, test cases, and following CodingStyle.
* If you have issue regarding the assignment, contact the TA, not the doctor.
* Get your submission on a flash drive and discuss your submission with the TA during the first lab after the deadline.
* The TA will not tell you your mark. He will report his evaluation to me and I will make the final evaluation.
* You are allowed to submit after the deadline with 10% mark-deduction for each late day.

------------------------------------------

Implement a Suffix Array prefix doubling O(n (log n)^2) construction algorithm as described in our lecture.
Do not use string class, use char arrays.
Your code must be general to handle any string.
Use standard C++, such that the following main() works. You are not allowed to modify the main().
You are not allowed to include any files or built-in libraries, except for output.
Do not write the main() again in your submission.
Half the mark is dedicatd to comments explaining the code before each code line, test cases, and following the CodingStyle.pdf file.

Use the following method to construct the suffix array:
* Construct an array such that each element contains 3 integers:
   - ind: index of a suffix.
   - r1: the current order of the suffix.
   - r2: the order that will be used in case there is a tie in r1.
* At each stage, do the following:
   - Sort the above array using <r1,r2>.
   - Move sequentially on the array elements to update r1 for each element.
   - Sort the above array using ind.
   - Move sequentially on the array elements to update r2 for each element.

int main()
{
    SuffixArray t("ACGACTACGATAAC$");

    t.ConstructUsingPrefixDoubling();

    t.Print(); // Prints:  14 11 12  0  6  3  9 13  1  7  4  2  8 10  5

    return 0;
}

------------------------------------------

To submit the code:
* Write your code in exactly one cpp text file such as myfile.cpp.
* Write your IDs and names as comments at the beginning of the code.
* Make sure that myfile.cpp contains the actual code, for example open it in Notepad (do not confuse it with cbp file).
* Encode the file using the assign_encoder tool as the following:
g++ -O3 -o assign_encoder.exe assign_encoder.cpp
assign_encoder.exe ./myfile.cpp 2 3 20101111 20102222 20113333
* The 2 in the above line is the assignment ID. The 3 in the above line is number of students.
* If you are a pre-master student, use the ID 20000000 and make sure your name exists as a comment at the beginning of the code.
* Open the resulting assign_2_20101111_20102222_20113333.bin file in a text editor.
* Make sure that the text-editor did not put any line-breaks (un-check the word-wrap option).
* Copy all the text included in the file.
* Submit the text via the following Google link, as well as your IDs. If the number of students is less than 5, put the number 00000000 in place of un-needed IDs.
