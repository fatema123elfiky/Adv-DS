Assignment 1 [10 marks]
Deadline: 5 Dec 2025

* This assignment can be done in teams of 5 students or less.
* Team members must be from the same lab so the TA can discuss all of them during one lab time.
* Each team must come up with their own implementation.
* Each student in the team must understand all details of the implementation.
* The code must contain no more than 15,000 characters.
* Your code must NOT include any TAB character. Convert each TAB to 4 spaces before submitting.
* You are not allowed to copy any piece of code from the internet or from any other resource.
* You are not allowed to copy any piece of code from other students.
* You are not allowed to include any files or built-in libraries, except for the described ones.
* Your coding style must follow exactly the coding style specified in CodingStyle.pdf.
* Half the mark is dedicated to comments explaining the code, test cases, and following CodingStyle.
* If you have issue regarding the assignment, contact the TA, not the doctor.
* Get your submission on a flash drive and discuss your submission with the TA during the first lab after the deadline.
* The TA will not tell you your mark. He will report his evaluation to me and I will make the final evaluation.
* You are allowed to submit after the deadline with 10% mark-deduction for each late day.

------------------------------------------

* Write a Standard C++ code that does the following:
* You are not allowed to use any built-in functions except: <cstdlib>, <cstdio>, <cstring>, <iostream>.
* You are not allowed to use string class, vector, or anything from STL libraries.

* Implement a BTree data structure as described in our lecture with O(n) space and O(log n) Insert() and O(n) Print() operations only in standard C++, such that the following main() works. You are not allowed to modify the main().
* Your code must be general and works for other data types and orders.
* You can assume that the number of levels in the BTree will not exceed 50.
* Half the mark is dedicatd to comments explaining the code before each code line, test cases, and following the CodingStyle.pdf file.

------------------------------------------

int main()
{
    // Construct a BTree of order 3, which stores int data
    BTree<int,3> t1;

    t1.Insert(1);
    t1.Insert(5);
    t1.Insert(0);
    t1.Insert(4);
    t1.Insert(3);
    t1.Insert(2);

    t1.Print(); // Should output the following on the screen:

    /*
    1,4
      0
      2,3
      5
    */

    // Construct a BTree of order 5, which stores char data
    BTree<char,5> t;

    // Look at the example in our lecture:
    t.Insert('G');
    t.Insert('I');
    t.Insert('B');
    t.Insert('J');
    t.Insert('C');
    t.Insert('A');
    t.Insert('K');
    t.Insert('E');
    t.Insert('D');
    t.Insert('S');
    t.Insert('T');
    t.Insert('R');
    t.Insert('L');
    t.Insert('F');
    t.Insert('H');
    t.Insert('M');
    t.Insert('N');
    t.Insert('P');
    t.Insert('Q');

    t.Print(); // Should output the following on the screen:

    /*
    K
      C,G
        A,B
        D,E,F
        H,I,J
      N,R
        L,M
        P,Q
        S,T
    */

    return 0;
}

------------------------------------------

To submit the code:
* Write your code in exactly one cpp text file such as myfile.cpp.
* Write your IDs and names as comments at the beginning of the code.
* Make sure that myfile.cpp contains the actual code, for example open it in Notepad (do not confuse it with cbp file).
* Encode the file using the assign_encoder tool as the following:
g++ -O3 -o assign_encoder.exe assign_encoder.cpp
assign_encoder.exe ./myfile.cpp 1 3 20101111 20102222 20113333
* The 1 in the above line is the assignment ID. The 3 in the above line is number of students.
* If you are a pre-master student, use the ID 20000000 and make sure your name exists as a comment at the beginning of the code.
* Open the resulting assign_1_20101111_20102222_20113333.bin file in a text editor.
* Make sure that the text-editor did not put any line-breaks (un-check the word-wrap option).
* Copy all the text included in the file.
* Submit the text via the following Google link, as well as your IDs. If the number of students is less than 5, put the number 00000000 in place of un-needed IDs.
